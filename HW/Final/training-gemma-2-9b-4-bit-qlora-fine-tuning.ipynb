    "## What this notebook is\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how I trained Gemma-2 9b to obtain LB: 0.941. The inference code can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/emiz6413/inference-gemma-2-9b-4-bit-qlora).\n",
    "I used 4-bit quantized [Gemma 2 9b Instruct](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-2-9b-it-bnb-4bit) uploaded by unsloth team as a base-model and added LoRA adapters and trained for 1 epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "\n",
    "I used `id % 5 == 0` as an evaluation set and used all the rest for training.\n",

    "## What is QLoRA fine-tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the conventional fine-tuning, weight ($\\mathbf{W}$) is updated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{W} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{W} - \\eta \\frac{{\\partial L}}{{\\partial \\mathbf{W}}} = \\mathbf{W} + \\Delta \\mathbf{W}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is a loss at this step and $\\eta$ is a learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "[LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) tries to approximate the $\\Delta \\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\text{d} \\times \\text{k}}$ by factorizing $\\Delta \\mathbf{W}$ into two (much) smaller matrices, $\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\text{d} \\times \\text{r}}$ and $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\text{r} \\times \\text{k}}$ with $r \\ll \\text{min}(\\text{d}, \\text{k})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta \\mathbf{W}_{s} \\approx \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/pii_data_detection/lora_diagram.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, only $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are updated while freezing the original weights, meaning that only a fraction (e.g. <1%) of the original weights need to be updated during training. This way, we can reduce the GPU memory usage significantly during training while achieving equivalent performance to the usual (full) fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "[QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) pushes the efficiency further by quantizing LLM. For example, a 8B parameter model alone would take up 32GB of VRAM in 32-bit, whereas quantized 8-bit/4-bit 8B model only need 8GB/4GB respectively. \n",
    "Note that QLoRA only quantize LLM's weights in low precision (e.g. 8-bit) while the computation of forward/backward are done in higher precision (e.g. 16-bit) and LoRA adapter's weights are also kept in higher precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 epoch using A6000 took ~15h in 4-bit while 8-bit took ~24h and the difference in log loss was not significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "It takes prohivitively long time to run full training on kaggle kernel. I recommend to use external compute resource to run the full training.\n",
    "This notebook uses only 100 samples for demo purpose, but everything else is same as my setup."

      "Error processing text: [\"Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is an algorithm used for Bayesian learning and inference in machine learning. It combines the goodness of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Langevin dynamics to perform parameter estimation. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:\\n\\n1. Initialization: Start with an initial point (parameters) randomly.\\n\\n2. Mini-batch Gradient Computation: Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters using a small subset of the data (a mini-batch). This is similar to how SGD works.\\n\\n3. Update with Noise: Update the parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient, similar to SGD, but with a twist. The twist is that a small amount of Gaussian noise is added to the update. The noise makes the algorithm explore the parameter space more thoroughly.\\n\\n4. Iteration: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the algorithm converges, i.e., until the parameters stop changing significantly.\\n\\nThe addition of Gaussian noise to the parameter update allows SGLD to perform a form of exploration as it descends the gradient, which can help it to avoid local minima and find a more optimal solution. The size of the noise term is typically decreased over time, allowing the algorithm to settle into a minimum.\\n\\nThe SGLD algorithm is used to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which can then be used to make predictions. This makes it particularly useful in deep learning, where the model parameters are often high-dimensional and the posterior distribution is complex.\",\"Thompson Sampling is a popular algorithm used for solving multi-armed bandit problems, where the goal is to balance exploration (trying out different arms to learn their reward distributions) and exploitation (pulling the arm that you currently believe has the highest expected reward).\\n\\nStochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) can be used to perform the sampling required in the Thompson Sampling algorithm. Here is a general outline:\\n\\n1. Model Initialization: Start by choosing a model for the reward distribution of each arm. This could be a simple model like a Beta distribution for binary rewards, or a more complex model for non-binary rewards.\\n\\n2. SGLD Sampling: Use SGLD to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Each sample represents a possible \\\"world\\\" in which the arms have different expected rewards.\\n\\n3. Choosing an Arm: Use the Thompson Sampling algorithm to choose an arm to pull. This involves drawing a sample from the posterior distribution of each arm (using the samples obtained in step 2), and then pulling the arm with the highest sample.\\n\\n4. Updating the Model: Update your model of the reward distribution for the chosen arm based on the observed reward.\\n\\n5. Repeat: Go back to step 2, and repeat the process.\\n\\nBy using SGLD in this way, you can implement a Thompson Sampling algorithm that is capable of handling complex reward distributions and high-dimensional model parameters, which can be particularly useful in situations where the underlying reward distributions are not well-captured by simple models.\",\"While a full implementation would be quite involved, here's a very basic outline of how you might structure Python code to use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) in a Thompson Sampling algorithm. Note that this is just a conceptual implementation and doesn't provide actual working code.\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom your_sgd_library import SGLD\\n\\nclass ThompsonSampling:\\n    def __init__(self, n_arms, initial_parameters, step_size):\\n        self.n_arms = n_arms\\n        self.parameters = initial_parameters\\n        self.sgld = SGLD(step_size)\\n\\n    def update(self, chosen_arm, reward):\\n        # This function should update your model of the reward distribution for the chosen arm\\n        # This would typically involve performing a step of SGLD on the parameters for that arm\\n        grad = self.compute_gradient(chosen_arm, reward)\\n        self.parameters[chosen_arm] = self.sgld.step(self.parameters[chosen_arm], grad)\\n\\n    def compute_gradient(self, chosen_arm, reward):\\n        # This function should compute the gradient of the log-posterior of the reward distribution\\n        # This will depend on your specific choice of reward distribution\\n        pass\\n\\n    def sample(self):\\n        # This function should draw a sample from the posterior distribution for each arm\\n        # The simplest way to do this is to draw a sample from a Gaussian distribution with the current parameters\\n        samples = [np.random.normal(loc=param) for param in self.parameters]\\n        return samples\\n\\n    def choose_arm(self):\\n        # This function should choose an arm to pull\\n        # The simplest way to do this is to draw a sample for each arm and choose the one with the highest sample\\n        samples = self.sample()\\n        return np.argmax(samples)\\n```\\n\\nAgain, this is a very high-level outline, and a real implementation would need to handle things like choosing an appropriate step size, managing the noise term in the SGLD update, and choosing an appropriate reward distribution model for your specific problem. Moreover, you need to implement or use a library for SGLD as it's not readily available in common libraries like NumPy or SciPy.\",\"To use the Thompson Sampling with SGLD in a linear contextual bandit problem, you first need to understand the problem setup. A linear contextual bandit problem is a variation of the multi-armed bandit problem where you have access to a d-dimensional context vector x associated with each arm, and the expected reward for pulling an arm is a linear function of the context vector. The goal is to learn the weights of this linear function to maximize the total reward.\\n\\nHere's a basic way to adapt the previous pseudocode to a linear contextual bandit problem:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom your_sgd_library import SGLD\\n\\nclass LinearContextualBandit:\\n    def __init__(self, n_arms, d, initial_parameters, step_size):\\n        self.n_arms = n_arms\\n        self.d = d  # dimension of the context vector\\n        self.parameters = initial_parameters  # should be an array of shape (n_arms, d)\\n        self.sgld = SGLD(step_size)\\n\\n    def update(self, chosen_arm, reward, context):\\n        # This function should update your model of the reward distribution for the chosen arm\\n        grad = self.compute_gradient(chosen_arm, reward, context)\\n        self.parameters[chosen_arm] = self.sgld.step(self.parameters[chosen_arm], grad)\\n\\n    def compute_gradient(self, chosen_arm, reward, context):\\n        # This function should compute the gradient of the log-posterior of the reward distribution\\n        pass\\n\\n    def sample(self, contexts):\\n        # This function should draw a sample from the posterior distribution for each arm\\n        samples = [np.dot(contexts[i], np.random.normal(loc=param)) for i, param in enumerate(self.parameters)]\\n        return samples\\n\\n    def choose_arm(self, contexts):\\n        # This function should choose an arm to pull\\n        samples = self.sample(contexts)\\n        return np.argmax(samples)\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, the parameters are a set of weights for each arm, and the reward for each arm is a linear function of the context vector for that arm and its corresponding weights. You would use the observed rewards and the context vectors to update your estimate of the weights for each arm.\\n\\nNote that the `compute_gradient` function will need to be implemented depending on the specific reward distribution used in your problem. This code is highly conceptual and needs proper implementation of the SGLD algorithm and the corresponding gradient calculations.\",\"Yes, you can apply the Thompson Sampling algorithm using a single sample from the posterior distribution at inference time for each arm. In fact, that's a common way to implement Thompson Sampling.\\n\\nHere's how it works:\\n\\n1. For each arm in your bandit problem, you have a model of the reward distribution. You use SGLD during the learning phase to update the parameters of these distributions based on the rewards you observe.\\n\\n2. At inference time, you draw a single sample from the posterior distribution of each arm's reward. This sample represents a possible value for the expected reward of that arm.\\n\\n3. You then choose the arm with the highest sample as the arm to pull next.\\n\\nBy drawing a new sample at each step of the algorithm, you ensure that you're continually exploring the reward space. Over time, as you observe more rewards and update your models, the samples should become increasingly accurate representations of the true expected rewards, allowing you to exploit the best arms more often.\\n\\nRemember, Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic algorithm that trades off exploration and exploitation. So, even if an arm has a high expected reward according to the current sample, there's still a chance that another arm could give a higher reward. The algorithm takes this uncertainty into account when deciding which arm to pull next.\",\"Implementing Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and Thompson Sampling with Numpy will be more challenging because Numpy does not inherently provide auto-differentiation, which is needed to compute the gradients. \\n\\nHowever, here's a simplified version of how Thompson Sampling could be implemented in Python with Numpy, without SGLD:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nclass ThompsonSampling:\\n    def __init__(self, n_arms):\\n        self.n_arms = n_arms\\n        # Initialize parameters for Beta distribution for each arm\\n        self.alpha = np.ones(n_arms)\\n        self.beta = np.ones(n_arms)\\n\\n    def choose_arm(self):\\n        # Sample from the beta distribution for each arm\\n        theta_sample = np.random.beta(self.alpha, self.beta)\\n        # Choose the arm with the highest sample\\n        return np.argmax(theta_sample)\\n\\n    def update(self, chosen_arm, reward):\\n        # Update the parameters of the Beta distribution for the chosen arm\\n        self.alpha[chosen_arm] += reward\\n        self.beta[chosen_arm] += 1 - reward\\n```\\n\\nThis example is for a binary reward setup where each arm's reward distribution is modeled as a Beta distribution. When a reward is observed, the parameters of the Beta distribution for the chosen arm are updated. The `choose_arm` method samples from each arm's current Beta distribution and selects the arm with the largest sample.\\n\\nIf you want to use SGLD specifically, you would need to manually compute the gradients or use a library that can do this for you (like PyTorch or TensorFlow). As for the linear contextual bandit case, you would need to modify this code to include context vectors and use them in the parameter update and arm selection process.\",null,\"Here's a basic implementation of Bayesian logistic regression using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) for parameter updates. This is a simplified version and doesn't include some important aspects such as tuning of hyperparameters (like the step size for SGLD and parameters for the prior distribution) and convergence checks for the SGLD algorithm.\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nclass BayesianLogisticRegression:\\n    def __init__(self, dim, step_size):\\n        self.dim = dim\\n        self.step_size = step_size\\n        self.beta = np.zeros(dim)\\n\\n    def sigmoid(self, x):\\n        return 1 \\/ (1 + np.exp(-x))\\n\\n    def compute_gradient(self, x, y):\\n        y_pred = self.sigmoid(np.dot(x, self.beta))\\n        grad = np.dot(x.T, y - y_pred)\\n        return grad\\n\\n    def update(self, x, y):\\n        grad = self.compute_gradient(x, y)\\n        noise = np.random.normal(size=self.dim)\\n        self.beta += self.step_size * grad + noise\\n\\n    def predict_proba(self, x):\\n        return self.sigmoid(np.dot(x, self.beta))\\n```\\n\\nYou can use this class to train a Bayesian logistic regression model by calling the `update` method with your data. After training, you can use the `predict_proba` method to make predictions. The `update` method uses SGLD to update the parameters, adding Gaussian noise to the gradient of the log-likelihood.\\n\\nRemember, this is a very simplified implementation. For a realistic application, you would also need to include a prior distribution for the parameters, tune the step size and noise level for the SGLD updates, and check for convergence of the algorithm.\"].

      "Error processing text: [\"Philosophy and mathematics are two distinct disciplines, but they share a deep and interconnected relationship. Philosophy is the study of fundamental problems concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, and language, while mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, patterns, and abstract structures. The following are some ways in which philosophy is related to mathematics:\\n\\n1. Foundations: Philosophy critically examines the foundations, assumptions, and principles that underlie mathematical theories and methods. Philosophers of mathematics inquire about the nature of mathematical objects (such as numbers and geometric shapes), the existence of abstract entities, and the nature of mathematical truth.\\n\\n2. Epistemology: Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and scope of knowledge. In the context of mathematics, philosophers investigate how mathematical knowledge is acquired, justified, and communicated. They explore questions like, \\\"Is mathematical knowledge purely a priori (independent of experience) or does it also rely on empirical observation?\\\" and \\\"How do we come to know mathematical truths?\\\"\\n\\n3. Logic: Logic, a subfield of both philosophy and mathematics, deals with the principles of valid reasoning and inference. Mathematical logic, in particular, plays a crucial role in the development of mathematical theories, as it provides the language and formal tools to express and deduce mathematical statements rigorously.\\n\\n4. Philosophy of mathematics: This is a specific branch of philosophy that focuses on understanding and interpreting the nature of mathematics itself. It deals with questions like, \\\"Are mathematical entities real or just human constructs?\\\", \\\"What is the nature of mathematical truth?\\\", and \\\"What is the role of intuition in mathematics?\\\" Different philosophical views on mathematics include Platonism, formalism, intuitionism, and constructivism, each with its own perspective on these questions.\\n\\n5. Ethical and social implications: Both philosophy and mathematics can inform and influence our understanding of ethical and social issues. For example, decision theory and game theory, which are branches of applied mathematics, can be used to analyze and inform ethical and social decision-making processes.\\n\\nIn summary, philosophy and mathematics are related in various ways, as philosophy provides a critical analysis of the foundations, assumptions, and principles underlying mathematics. It also examines the nature of mathematical knowledge, the role of logic, and the ethical and social implications of mathematical theories and applications. The interplay between philosophy and mathematics has led to a deeper understanding of both fields, enriching our knowledge and appreciation of the world we live in.\",\"In both philosophy and mathematics, structure plays a significant role. The term \\\"structure\\\" generally refers to the arrangement of and relations between the parts or elements of something complex. It is a fundamental concept in various areas of study, as it helps us understand, analyze, and communicate complex ideas and systems. Here's how structure is relevant to both fields:\\n\\n1. Mathematics: In mathematics, the study of structure is core to understanding various branches such as algebra, geometry, topology, and more. Mathematicians investigate the properties, patterns, and relationships that exist within different mathematical structures such as groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and manifolds. By understanding these structures, mathematicians can develop a greater insight into the properties of numbers, shapes, and patterns, as well as create new mathematical theories and solve complex problems.\\n\\n2. Philosophy: In philosophy, structure is important for organizing complex ideas and arguments. Philosophers often create structured frameworks to analyze and communicate their thoughts on various subjects like ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and logic. For example, in metaphysics, philosophers might develop structured models of reality to better understand the nature of existence. In ethics, philosophers build frameworks to evaluate moral principles and actions systematically.\\n\\nIn both disciplines, structure serves as a foundation for understanding, analyzing, and communicating complicated ideas and systems. The concept of structure allows us to break down complex entities into smaller, more manageable parts and examine the relationships between them. By doing so, we can gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the world around us.\",null,\"Determining when to prioritize structure over concept depends on the context and the objectives of a particular study or project. Here are some situations where focusing on structure might be more important than emphasizing the concept:\\n\\n1. Teaching or learning a new subject: When introducing a new topic or trying to understand a complex idea, it can be helpful to prioritize the structure of the material. This enables learners to grasp the relationships between different elements and see how they fit together, making it easier to comprehend the overall concept.\\n\\n2. Problem-solving and analysis: In some cases, understanding the structure of a problem or a system can be crucial for finding a solution or conducting an analysis. By focusing on the structure, we can identify patterns, relationships, and key elements that can help us tackle the problem more effectively.\\n\\n3. Communication and presentation: When conveying information or presenting an argument, it is often essential to prioritize the structure of the content. A well-structured presentation or argument enables the audience to follow the logic and understand the key points more easily, ultimately making the concept clearer.\\n\\n4. Development of frameworks and models: In many disciplines, creating structured frameworks and models is crucial for understanding complex phenomena. Focusing on structure can help identify key variables, their relationships, and the underlying patterns that can be used to predict or explain the phenomena in question.\\n\\n5. Organizing information: In cases where a large amount of information needs to be managed or processed, prioritizing structure can help establish a systematic and logical way of organizing the data, making it more accessible and understandable.\\n\\nHowever, it is essential to strike a balance between structure and concept, as an overemphasis on either aspect could lead to an incomplete understanding or ineffective communication. Both structure and concept are important components of understanding and conveying complex ideas, and their relative importance depends on the specific context and objectives at hand.\",\"Teaching a structure and synthesizing the structure via specific concept learning represent two different approaches to learning and instruction. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, and the choice between them depends on the specific goals, context, and needs of the learners.\\n\\nTeaching a structure:\\n\\nIn this approach, the focus is on providing students with an overarching framework or structure that organizes the subject matter. The structure serves as a \\\"skeleton\\\" that helps learners understand the relationships between different concepts and how they fit together in the broader context.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n- Provides a clear and organized context for learning, which can make it easier for students to grasp complex ideas.\\n- Helps learners to see the \\\"big picture\\\" and understand how various concepts relate to one another.\\n- Encourages a systematic and logical approach to learning, which can facilitate the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\\n\\nDrawbacks:\\n- May not provide enough specific examples or concrete details to fully engage learners or help them understand the practical applications of the concepts.\\n- Can be overwhelming or confusing for students who prefer a more concrete, step-by-step learning process.\\n\\nSynthesizing the structure via specific concept learning:\\n\\nIn this approach, students learn specific concepts and gradually build the structure themselves as they progress through the material. By focusing on individual concepts and their connections, learners can \\\"synthesize\\\" the overall structure in a more organic and intuitive way.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n- Allows for a more in-depth and detailed exploration of individual concepts, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\\n- Gives learners the opportunity to discover connections between concepts on their own, which can promote a sense of ownership and engagement in the learning process.\\n- Can be more flexible and adaptable to the needs and interests of individual learners, as it allows them to focus on specific concepts that they find most interesting or challenging.\\n\\nDrawbacks:\\n- May lead to a fragmented or incomplete understanding of the overall structure if learners do not make the necessary connections between concepts.\\n- Can be less efficient in terms of time and effort, as learners must \\\"piece together\\\" the structure themselves.\\n\\nUltimately, the choice between teaching a structure and synthesizing the structure via specific concept learning depends on the goals of the instruction, the nature of the subject matter, and the individual needs and preferences of the learners. In practice, a combination of both approaches is often most effective, as it provides learners with a balance of structure and flexibility, promoting a deep and holistic understanding of the material.\"].

Good luck, and I hope this helps you prepare!\",null,\"Certainly! Here are some example interview questions related to deep learning, along with thorough model answers:\\n\\n1. **Question: What is the vanishing gradient problem, and how can it be addressed in deep learning?**\\n   \\n   Model Answer:\\n   The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the neural network become extremely small as they are back-propagated through the network during training. This can prevent the lower layers of the network from learning effectively. One approach to addressing this issue is to use activation functions that are less prone to saturation, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or Leaky ReLU. Additionally, techniques like batch normalization and skip connections in architectures like ResNet can also help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by providing more stable gradients during training.\\n\\n2. **Question: Explain the concept of transfer learning and its application in deep learning.**\\n   \\n   Model Answer:\\n   Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset is used as a starting point for a new task or dataset. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning allows us to leverage the knowledge learned from the source task and apply it to the target task. This can be particularly useful when the target dataset is small or when computational resources are limited. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the new dataset, we can achieve good performance with less training time and data. For example, a pre-trained image classification model like VGG or Inception can be used as a feature extractor for a new task like object detection or image segmentation.\\n\\n3. **Question: Can you describe the difference between a local minimum and a global minimum in the context of optimization?**\\n   \\n   Model Answer:\\n   In the context of optimization, a local minimum is a point in the parameter space where the objective function reaches a low value, but it is not the lowest possible value in the entire space. A global minimum, on the other hand, is the point where the objective function reaches the absolute lowest value across the entire parameter space. In deep learning, the goal of optimization algorithms like gradient descent is to find the global minimum, as it represents the best set of parameters for the model. However, it's important to be aware that deep learning models often have complex, non-convex loss surfaces, which can make it challenging to guarantee convergence to a global minimum.\\n\\n4. **Question: How would you approach the task of designing a convolutional neural network for image recognition?**\\n   \\n   Model Answer:\\n   When designing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition, several key components need to be considered. Firstly, the architecture typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. It's important to choose an appropriate number of layers and filter sizes to capture meaningful features from the images. Additionally, the use of techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization can help improve generalization and prevent overfitting. Choosing an appropriate loss function and optimization algorithm is also crucial. Lastly, model evaluation and fine-tuning hyperparameters play a significant role in achieving optimal performance.\\n\\nThese model answers aim to provide comprehensive and clear explanations to showcase your understanding of the concepts. When preparing for an interview, it's essential to be able to communicate your knowledge effectively and demonstrate your problem-solving skills. Good luck with your interview preparation!\"].

Create a budget: The first step to financial security is to create a budget that tracks your income and expenses. This will help you understand where your money is going and identify areas where you can cut back.\\n2. Save regularly: Once you have a budget, make a plan to save a certain amount of money each month. This can be done by setting aside a certain percentage of your income into a savings account or other low-risk investment.\\n3. Invest wisely: Investing your money is an important part of achieving financial security. However, it is essential to do your research and choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.\\n4. Pay off debt: High-interest debt, such as credit card balances, can quickly eat away at your financial security. Make a plan to pay off your debt as quickly as possible, while still making timely payments on other obligations.\\n5. Protect your assets: Financial security is not just about having money, but also protecting what you have. Make sure to have appropriate insurance coverage, such as life insurance, home insurance, and car insurance, to protect your assets.\\n\\nRemember, achieving financial security is a long-term process that requires discipline and patience.

The effects of a tsunami can be far-reaching and devastating, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, the environment, and human life.\\n\\nOne of the most immediate effects of a tsunami is the loss of life. Tsunamis can travel at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour and can be as tall as 30 feet, making them virtually unstoppable. When a tsunami strikes, it can sweep away everything in its path, including buildings, vehicles, and people. In fact, tsunamis have been known to cause more damage and loss of life than any other natural disaster, including hurricanes and earthquakes.\\n\\nIn addition to the loss of life, tsunamis can also cause extensive damage to infrastructure and the environment. Tsunami waves can wash away roads, bridges, and buildings, leaving behind a trail of destruction and debris. The waves can also cause flooding, contaminate water supplies, and damage crops and livestock. The damage caused by a tsunami can be so severe that it can take years for communities to recover.\\n\\nThe impact of a tsunami can also be felt far beyond the immediate area affected by the disaster. Tsunamis can cause widespread displacement, as people are forced to flee their homes and seek shelter elsewhere. This can lead to a strain on resources, such as food, water, and shelter, and can also lead to social and economic disruption.\\n\\nFurthermore, the psychological impact of a tsunami should not be underestimated. Survivors of a tsunami may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, which can affect their ability to recover and rebuild their lives.\\n\\nIn addition to the direct impact of a tsunami, there can also be long-term effects on the environment and ecosystems. Tsunamis can cause changes in the ocean floor and sediment distribution, which can affect marine life and the ecosystem as a whole. The debris and pollutants left behind by a tsunami can also have a lasting impact on the environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the effects of a tsunami can be far-reaching and devastating, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, the environment, and human life. While the immediate aftermath of a tsunami is often the most destructive, the long-term effects can be just as severe. It is therefore crucial that communities at risk of tsunamis have adequate early warning systems and emergency preparedness plans in place to minimize the impact of such disasters.\",null].

Think of it like a container that holds another component and provides additional props or functionality to that component.\\nWhy use HOCs?\\nThere are several reasons why you might want to use HOCs in React:\\n1. **Decoupling**: HOCs allow you to decouple a component from its dependencies, making it easier to test and maintain. By wrapping a component in an HOC, you can separate the logic that depends on the component from the component itself.\\n2. **Reusability**: HOCs can make components more reusable by providing a way to apply common functionality to multiple components.\\n3. **Modularization**: HOCs can help you create more modular code by allowing you to break down a large component into smaller, more manageable pieces.\\n4. **Better debugging**: By wrapping a component in an HOC, you can easily debug the component and its dependencies without having to worry about the complexity of the original component.\\nHere's a simple demo of how to use HOCs in React:\\n### Creating an HOC\\nLet's say you have a `Button` component that you want to use in multiple places throughout your app. Instead of copying and pasting the same code for each button, you can create an HOC that provides the common functionality for all buttons.

      "Error processing text: [null,\"The story you are referring to is likely \\\"Toward the Beloved City\\\" by Philip K. Dick. This story was not published as a standalone novel but rather as part of an anthology. Philip K. Dick (1928\\u20131982) was an American author known for his influential work in science fiction, with stories often exploring themes of reality, identity, and human nature.\\n\\nThe title \\\"Toward the Beloved City\\\" is a bit unusual for a Philip K. Dick story, and it might be that the story is lesser-known or that the title is slightly misremembered. It is also possible that the story was included in a collection with a similar name.\\n\\nIf \\\"Toward the Beloved City\\\" does not yield the desired results, consider looking for anthologies or collections that include Philip K. Dick's work around the time you remember reading it. You may also want to search for variations of the title or look for keywords and themes you recall from the story.\\n\\nAlternatively, if this is not the correct title or author, providing more details about the story's plot, characters, or specific elements can help in identifying it. Remember that titles can sometimes be misremembered, so any additional information could be crucial in tracking down the story you are looking for.\",\"Given that the story you are recalling is a science fiction story with Christian allegories, and the title you remember is \\\"Towards the Beloved City,\\\" it is possible that you are thinking of \\\"Toward the Beloved City\\\" by the author Philip Jos\\u00e9 Farmer.

Dick, as I previously mentioned, but rather from another iconic science fiction writer, Philip Jos\\u00e9 Farmer.\\n\\nPhilip Jos\\u00e9 Farmer was known for his use of religious and mythological themes within his science fiction and fantasy works. He wrote several stories and novels that incorporated such allegories, though \\\"Toward the Beloved City\\\" is not one of his most famous works, which might explain why it has been harder to track down.\\n\\nIf this is indeed the story you are looking for, it might help to look through collections of Farmer's works or anthologies of science fiction stories that might include it.

Here's an example of how you can create a plugin to modify the entry point:\\n\\n1. Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `modify-entry-plugin.js`, and define the plugin:\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass ModifyEntryPlugin {\\n  constructor(newEntry) {\\n    this.newEntry = newEntry;\\n  }\\n\\n  apply(compiler) {\\n    compiler.hooks.entryOption.tap('ModifyEntryPlugin', (context, entry) => {\\n      \\/\\/ Modify the entry point here\\n      entry = this.newEntry;\\n      return true;\\n    });\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = ModifyEntryPlugin;\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `ModifyEntryPlugin` class accepts a new entry point as a constructor parameter. The `apply` method is called by Webpack, and we use the `entryOption` hook to tap into the entry point manipulation process. We replace the entry point with our new entry point and return `true` to signal that the entry point has been successfully modified.\\n\\n2. Import and use the plugin in your `webpack.config.js` file:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst ModifyEntryPlugin = require('.\\/modify-entry-plugin');\\n\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  \\/\\/ Your existing Webpack configuration\\n  entry: '.\\/src\\/index.js', \\/\\/ The original entry point\\n  plugins: [\\n    \\/\\/ Other plugins\\n    new ModifyEntryPlugin('.\\/src\\/new-entry.js'), \\/\\/ Use the custom plugin to modify the entry point\\n  ],\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the original entry point is `.\\/src\\/index.js`, and we use our custom `ModifyEntryPlugin` to change it to `.\\/src\\/new-entry.js`. When Webpack builds the bundle, it will use the new entry point specified by the plugin.\",\"Yes, when Webpack processes the configuration with the entry point specified as a string like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  entry: '\\/Users\\/joey.nguyen\\/projects\\/app\\/src\\/index.tsx'\\n}\\n```\\n\\nInternally, Webpack transforms the entry point into an object format:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  main: { import: ['\\/Users\\/joey.nguyen\\/projects\\/app\\/src\\/index.tsx'] }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis allows Webpack to handle multiple entry points and additional entry configuration options. The transformed format is what Webpack actually uses to compile the application, but you can simply use the string format for single entry points in your configuration for simplicity.\",\"To transform the entry point to use the `boot` key instead of the default `main` key, you can modify your Webpack configuration like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  \\/\\/ Your existing Webpack configuration\\n  entry: {\\n    boot: '\\/Users\\/joey.nguyen\\/projects\\/app\\/src\\/index.tsx',\\n  },\\n  \\/\\/ Other configuration options\\n};\\n```\\n\\nBy providing an object with the `boot` key instead of a string, you tell Webpack to use the specified file as the entry point for the `boot` chunk. This will generate a separate output file for the `boot` entry, usually named `boot.js` or `boot.bundle.js`, depending on your output configuration.\",\"If you can only modify the entry point using a Webpack plugin, you can create a custom plugin to change the entry point as needed. Here's an example of how you can create a plugin to modify the entry point:\\n\\n1.

When Webpack builds the bundle, it will use the new entry point specified by the plugin.\",\"The current implementation of the `ChangeEntryPointPlugin` provided in the previous answer only changes the `boot` entry point. If you want to change all the entry points in the Webpack configuration, you can modify the plugin like this:\\n\\n1. Update the `change-entry-point-plugin.js` file:\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass ChangeAllEntryPointsPlugin {\\n  constructor(newEntryPoint) {\\n    this.newEntryPoint = newEntryPoint;\\n  }\\n\\n  apply(compiler) {\\n    compiler.hooks.entryOption.tap('ChangeAllEntryPointsPlugin', (context, entry) => {\\n      \\/\\/ Modify all the entry points here\\n      for (const key in entry) {\\n        entry[key] = {\\n          import: [this.newEntryPoint],\\n        };\\n      }\\n      return true;\\n    });\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = ChangeAllEntryPointsPlugin;\\n```\\n\\nIn the `apply` method, we now loop through all the entry points in the `entry` object and update their import paths to the new entry point provided in the constructor.\\n\\n2. Update the usage of the plugin in your `webpack.config.js` file:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst ChangeAllEntryPointsPlugin = require('.\\/change-entry-point-plugin');\\n\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  \\/\\/ Your existing Webpack configuration\\n  entry: {\\n    main: '.\\/src\\/index.js',\\n    anotherEntry: '.\\/src\\/another-entry.js',\\n  },\\n  plugins: [\\n    \\/\\/ Other plugins\\n    new ChangeAllEntryPointsPlugin('\\/Users\\/joey.nguyen\\/projects\\/app\\/src\\/index.tsx'),\\n  ],\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow, when you run Webpack with this configuration, the custom `ChangeAllEntryPointsPlugin` will update all the entry points (in this example, both `main` and `anotherEntry`) to use the new entry point specified by the plugin (`\\/Users\\/joey.nguyen\\/projects\\/app\\/src\\/index.tsx`).\",\"In Webpack, `tap`, `tapAsync`, and `tapPromise` are methods used in the Tapable plugin system to hook into various build lifecycle events. These methods are used to define different ways of interacting with the hooks.\\n\\n1. `tap`: This method is used to hook into a synchronous event. When using `tap`, your plugin's function is called synchronously, and you don't need to handle any callback or promise. You can simply execute your code and return the result.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```javascript\\ncompiler.hooks.someSyncHook.tap('MyPlugin', (param1, param2) => {\\n  \\/\\/ Do something synchronously with param1 and param2\\n});\\n```\\n\\n2. `tapAsync`: This method is used to hook into an asynchronous event that accepts a callback. When using `tapAsync`, your plugin's function is provided with a callback as the last argument. You must call this callback once your async operation is complete.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```javascript\\ncompiler.hooks.someAsyncHook.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (param1, param2, callback) => {\\n  \\/\\/ Do something asynchronously with param1 and param2\\n  someAsyncFunction(param1, param2, (err, result) => {\\n    \\/\\/ Handle the async result and call the callback\\n    callback(err, result);\\n  });\\n});\\n```\\n\\n3. `tapPromise`: This method is used to hook into an asynchronous event that works with Promises. When using `tapPromise`, your plugin's function should return a Promise.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```javascript\\ncompiler.hooks.someAsyncHook.tapPromise('MyPlugin', async (param1, param2) => {\\n  \\/\\/ Do something asynchronously with param1 and param2 using Promises\\n  const result = await someAsyncFunction(param1, param2);\\n  return result;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn the context of your original question, `hooks.entryOption` is an event in the Webpack compilation process. You can use `tap`, `tapAsync`, or `tapPromise` to hook into this event, based on whether your plugin needs to perform synchronous or asynchronous operations. For most cases, using `tap` is sufficient when modifying the entry point.\",\"The issue you're encountering is likely caused by modifying the `entry` object directly. The `entry` object is not the actual source of truth for Webpack entry points; it's a reference to the original configuration. To properly modify the entry points, you need to use the `compiler.options.entry` object instead.\\n\\nHere's an updated version of your plugin:\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass CustomOutputPlugin {\\n  apply(compiler) {\\n    compiler.hooks.entryOption.tap(\\\"CustomOutputPlugin\\\", (context, entry) => {\\n      \\/\\/ Modify the compiler.options.entry object\\n      compiler.options.entry.boot = compiler.options.entry.main;\\n      delete compiler.options.entry.main;\\n      return true;\\n    });\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = CustomOutputPlugin;\\n```\\n\\nThis version of the plugin modifies the `compiler.options.entry` object, which is the actual source of truth for the entry points. After making this change, Webpack should compile the bundle as expected with the updated entry points.\",\"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Upon further investigation, it seems that modifying the entry points during the `entryOption` hook might not be the best approach. Instead, you can use the `beforeRun` or `run` hooks to make changes to the entry points before the compilation starts.\\n\\nHere's an updated version of the plugin that should work:\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass CustomOutputPlugin {\\n  apply(compiler) {\\n    compiler.hooks.beforeRun.tapAsync(\\\"CustomOutputPlugin\\\", (compilation, callback) => {\\n      \\/\\/ Modify the compiler.options.entry object\\n      compiler.options.entry.boot = compiler.options.entry.main;\\n      delete compiler.options.entry.main;\\n\\n      \\/\\/ Update context and entry reference\\n      context = compiler.context;\\n      entry = compiler.options.entry;\\n\\n      callback();\\n    });\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = CustomOutputPlugin;\\n```\\n\\nThis version of the plugin uses the `beforeRun` hook and modifies the `compiler.options.entry` object before the compilation starts. The `beforeRun` hook is asynchronous, so we use `tapAsync` and provide a callback. Be sure to call the `callback()` at the end to signal that the plugin has finished its work.\\n\\nNow, when you use this updated plugin in your Webpack configuration, the entry points should be modified correctly, and the bundle should be compiled as expected.\",\"Apologies for the confusion in my previous answer. You are correct, it should be `compilation.options.entry`. Here's the corrected version of the plugin:\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass CustomOutputPlugin {\\n  apply(compiler) {\\n    compiler.hooks.beforeRun.tapAsync(\\\"CustomOutputPlugin\\\", (compilation, callback) => {\\n      \\/\\/ Modify the compilation.options.entry object\\n      compilation.options.entry.boot = compilation.options.entry.main;\\n      delete compilation.options.entry.main;\\n\\n      callback();\\n    });\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = CustomOutputPlugin;\\n```\\n\\nBy modifying the `compilation.options.entry` object in the `beforeRun` hook, you can now correctly update the entry points before the compilation starts.\"].

Here are some common approaches:\\n\\n1. Lifestyle changes: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help manage hypertension. This includes maintaining a balanced diet (such as the DASH diet), reducing sodium intake, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, and managing stress levels.\\n\\n2. Medication: If lifestyle changes alone are not sufficient, your doctor may prescribe antihypertensive medications. There are different types of medications available, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and others. The specific medication(s) prescribed will depend on your individual circumstances.\\n\\n3. Regular monitoring: It's important to regularly check your blood pressure levels to ensure they are within the target range. Your doctor will advise you on the frequency of monitoring and may recommend using a home blood pressure monitor.\\n\\n4. Ongoing management: Hypertension is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. It is crucial to consistently follow your doctor's recommendations, take prescribed medications as directed, and attend regular check-ups to monitor your blood pressure and overall health.\\n\\nRemember to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific situation.\",\"Performing a buried suture for skin repair typically involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Preparation: Ensure you have the necessary sterile instruments, sutures, and local anesthesia if required. Clean and prep the wound area.\\n\\n2. Suture selection: Choose an absorbable suture material such as polyglactin (e.g., Vicryl) for buried sutures. The suture size should be appropriate for the wound and tissue thickness.\\n\\n3. Needle selection: Use a curved cutting needle for ease of penetration and to minimize tissue trauma.\\n\\n4. Suture placement: Start by inserting the needle through the deeper layer of tissue on one side of the wound, ensuring a good bite through the tissue. Pull the needle through and leave a long tail of suture material.\\n\\n5. Needle exit: Traverse across the wound to the opposite side, ensuring that the needle passes through the same depth of tissue on this side as well.\\n\\n6. Tying off: Once the suture has been passed through both sides of the wound, tie the two ends of the suture together securely. This can be done with a knot or by using instrument tie techniques.\\n\\n7. Subcutaneous sutures: If additional layers of sutures are required, repeat the above steps for each layer. Ensure that the sutures are placed accurately to provide adequate wound approximation.\\n\\n8. Wound closure: Finally, close the skin using an appropriate technique such as interrupted or continuous sutures, depending on the wound characteristics and surgeon preference.\\n\\nIt's important to note that performing a buried suture requires proper training and expertise. If you're not a medical professional, it's best to seek assistance from a healthcare provider or a trained healthcare professional to ensure proper wound closure and minimize complications.\",\"The use of antihypertensive medications can vary among individuals, including African Americans, due to a combination of factors, including genetics, healthcare disparities, and individual patient characteristics.\\n\\n1. Genetic factors: Some studies have found that genetic variations can influence how individuals respond to certain antihypertensive medications. For example, African Americans tend to have a higher prevalence of salt-sensitive hypertension, which means they may respond better to certain classes of medications, such as diuretics or calcium channel blockers.\\n\\n2. Healthcare disparities: Disparities in healthcare access and quality can contribute to differences in medication prescribing patterns. African Americans, along with other minority groups, may face barriers to healthcare, including limited access to medical services, lower rates of health insurance coverage, and bias in healthcare delivery. These factors can impact the likelihood of receiving appropriate antihypertensive medications.\\n\\n3. Patient characteristics: Individual patient factors, such as age, overall health, presence of comorbidities, and medication side effects, may influence the choice of antihypertensive medications. Different medications may be more suitable for certain individuals based on their specific medical needs and tolerability.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that these explanations are general and do not apply to every individual. The choice of antihypertensive medications should be personalized and based on the patient's unique characteristics, in accordance with medical guidelines and the professional judgment of healthcare providers. It's important for individuals to have open and informed discussions with their healthcare providers to ensure they receive the most appropriate and effective treatment for their hypertension.\",\"There is evidence to suggest that there is a link between multiple sclerosis (MS) and geographic location. The prevalence and incidence of MS vary significantly across different regions of the world. Some key observations include:\\n\\n1. Latitude gradient: MS is more common at higher latitudes and less common near the equator. This pattern has been observed in various studies and is referred to as the \\\"latitude gradient.\\\" The risk of developing MS increases as one moves farther away from the equator.\\n\\n2. Migration studies: Individuals who move from a low-risk area to a high-risk area before the age of 15 tend to acquire the risk of their new location. Similarly, those who move from a high-risk area to a low-risk area before the age of 15 tend to acquire the risk of their original location. These migration patterns suggest that environmental factors during childhood play a role in MS development.\\n\\n3. Ethnic and genetic factors: The risk of MS varies among different ethnic groups. It is more common in individuals of Northern European descent and less common in those of African, Asian, or Native American descent. Genetic factors may contribute to these differences in susceptibility.\\n\\n4. Environmental factors: Environmental factors, such as exposure to sunlight and vitamin D levels, have been implicated in the geographic distribution of MS. Sunlight exposure and higher vitamin D levels near the equator may have a protective effect against MS.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while location and environmental factors are associated with the risk of developing MS, they do not directly cause the disease. The exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between MS and location are still being investigated. Genetics, immune system dysregulation, and other factors likely interact with environmental factors to contribute to the development of MS.\",\"There is a well-established association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), although the exact nature of this relationship is still not fully understood. Here are some key points regarding the link between MS and EBV:\\n\\n1. Increased prevalence of EBV in MS patients: Studies have consistently shown that individuals with MS are more likely to have been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus compared to the general population. It is estimated that over 90% of people with MS have been infected with EBV, compared to around 60-80% of the general population.\\n\\n2. Timing of EBV infection: Research suggests that the timing of EBV infection may be relevant to the development of MS. It is believed that primary infection with EBV during adolescence or young adulthood, particularly if it is symptomatic or leads to infectious mononucleosis (IM), may increase the risk of developing MS later in life.\\n\\n3. Immune response and autoreactivity: EBV infection can lead to the activation of certain immune cells, including B cells, which are thought to play a role in the development of MS. It is hypothesized that in some individuals, the immune response triggered by EBV may result in autoreactivity, leading to an attack against the body's own tissues, including the central nervous system.\\n\\n4. Viral persistence and reactivation: EBV has the ability to establish lifelong latent infection in B lymphocytes, allowing the virus to persist in the body. Periodic reactivation of the virus can occur, leading to increased immune activity. This ongoing immune response may contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in MS.\\n\\n5. EBV and MS risk genes: Some studies have identified genetic variations associated with both increased risk of MS and altered immune response to EBV infection. These genetic factors may contribute to the susceptibility to both MS and EBV.\\n\\nWhile the association between EBV and MS is well-documented, it's important to note that EBV infection alone is not sufficient to cause MS. Other genetic, environmental, and immunological factors likely interact with EBV to contribute to the development of MS.

However, these countries are also taking a number of initiatives to address these challenges and improve the environment.\\n\\n* **Air pollution** is a major problem in South Asia, and it is linked to a number of health problems, such as respiratory disease and cancer. To address this problem, many South Asian countries have introduced policies to reduce air pollution, such as fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles, emissions testing for vehicles, and smokeless cooking fuels.\\n* **Water pollution** is also a major problem in South Asia, and it can lead to a number of health problems, such as diarrhea and cholera. To address this problem, many South Asian countries have introduced policies to reduce water pollution, such as wastewater treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, and water quality standards.\\n* **Climate change** is a global problem, but it is having a particularly severe impact on South Asia. The region is already experiencing more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. To address this problem, many South Asian countries are working to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, such as by increasing the use of renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency.\\n\\nIn addition to these specific initiatives, South Asian countries are also working together to address environmental challenges. In 2016, for example, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) adopted a regional action plan on climate change. This plan includes a number of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency.\\n\\nThe South Asian countries are facing a number of environmental challenges, but they are also taking a number of initiatives to address these challenges and improve the environment. These initiatives are making a difference, and they are helping to create a more sustainable future for South Asia.\",null]. Error: sequence item 1: expected str instance, NoneType found\n"

You may need to request access or login credentials from the database administrator.\\n\\n- The error message indicates the MySQL server is trying to use the 'caching_sha2_password' authentication plugin, but unable to load it. This may be because that plugin or library is missing on the server. Ask the DB admin to check the server configuration regarding authentication plugins.\\n\\n- Try increasing the connection timeout value passed to the MySQL client library to allow more time for the connection attempt. Often the default 10 seconds is not enough. Try increasing to 30 or 60 seconds.\\n\\n- Check for any network\\/firewall issues that could be blocking the connection attempt.

      "Error processing text: [\"This error means that MySQL cannot load the caching_sha2_password authentication plugin. There are a few possible reasons for this:\\n\\n1. The plugin library file is missing. This is the most likely cause based on the error message. The caching_sha2_password.so file is missing from the plugin directory. You'll need to install it.\\n\\n2. The plugin directory is invalid. MySQL cannot find the \\/usr\\/local\\/lib\\/plugin directory. You may need to specify the correct plugin directory in your MySQL config.\\n\\n3. Permissions issue. MySQL does not have permission to read the plugin library file. You may need to adjust the file permissions.\\n\\n4. Version incompatibility. The caching_sha2_password plugin version may not be compatible with your MySQL server version. You may need to upgrade MySQL or downgrade the plugin.\\n\\nTo fix this, I would recommend the following steps:\\n\\n1. Check that the caching_sha2_password.so file exists in your MySQL plugin directory. If not, install it.\\n\\n2. Check that the plugin directory specified in your MySQL config (plugin_dir) points to the correct location.\\n\\n3.

      "Error processing text: [\"Afrasiab is a figure from ancient Persian mythology and literature. He is often depicted as a tyrant and the arch-nemesis of the Persian hero, Rostam. Afrasiab is the king of Turan, a historical region in Central Asia, which often symbolizes the enemies of Iran in the Persian epic, Shahnameh.\\n\\nThe Shahnameh, written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi around 1000 AD, contains many stories of Rostam's battles with Afrasiab and his Turanian forces. Despite his portrayal as a villain, Afrasiab is a complex character with his own motivations and conflicts.\\n\\nIn historical context, Afrasiab is believed to be based on a real historical figure, the king of Turan and a contemporary of the Persian king Cyrus the Great. However, the historical accuracy of these legends is uncertain.\\n\\nAfrasiab is also the name of an ancient city in Uzbekistan, known today as Samarkand. The city was one of the oldest inhabited cities in Central Asia, and the name \\\"Afrasiab\\\" is also used to refer to the pre-Mongol period of Samarkand's history.\",\"This lineage appears to be from the Zoroastrian text, Bundahishn, tracing the genealogy of Afrasiab (Frasiyav in this context) back to Gayomart, who is considered the first human in Zoroastrian mythology. From top to bottom, the lineage reads:\\n\\nFrasiyav (Afrasiab) >\\nPashang >\\nZaeshim >\\nTura >\\nSpaenyasp >\\nDuroshasp >\\nTuj >\\nFaridoon >\\nAspyan-i Pur-gav >\\nAspyan-i Sok-gav >\\nAspyan-i Bor-gav >\\nAspyan-i Siya-gav >\\nAspyan-i Spet-gav >\\nAspyan-i Gepr-gav >\\nAspyan-i Rama-gav >\\nAspyan-i Vapro-gav >\\nAspyan >\\nJam >\\nVivangah >\\nAyanhat >\\nHooshang >\\nFravak >\\nSiyamak >\\nMashye >\\nGayomart\\n\\nGayomart is a primordial figure in Zoroastrianism, often associated with the creation of mankind. This lineage suggests that Afrasiab is a direct descendant of this original human, connecting this legendary figure to the genesis of humanity according to Zoroastrian beliefs.\",\"This lineage, as provided by Abu Hanifa Dinawari, traces the genealogy of Firasyab (Afrasiab) back to Adam, the first man according to Abrahamic religions. Dinawari was a Persian astronomer, geographer, botanist, and historian, and his works are among the earliest extant writings in Persian after the Islamic conquest.\\n\\nThis lineage, from Firasyab to Adam, indicates a connection to Islamic and Judeo-Christian tradition, where many of these names are found in the Bible and the Quran. The lineage reads as follows:\\n\\nFirasyab (Afrasiab) > \\nTudhil > \\nTurk > \\nYafeth (Japheth in Biblical tradition) > \\nNuh (Noah in Biblical tradition) > \\nLamik (Lamech in Biblical tradition) > \\nMatushalakh (Methuselah in Biblical tradition) > \\nIdris (Enoch in Biblical tradition) > \\nYared (Jared in Biblical tradition) > \\nMahalalil (Mahalalel in Biblical tradition) > \\nQinan (Cainan in Biblical tradition) > \\nAnush (Enosh in Biblical tradition) > \\nSheeth (Seth in Biblical tradition) > \\nAdam\\n\\nThis lineage connects Afrasiab to the Abrahamic tradition, suggesting a shared heritage and history between these religious and cultural traditions.\",\"This lineage is from Kitab al-Khabar \\u02bfan al-Bashar, a historical text written by Al-Maqrizi, an Egyptian historian from the Mamluk period. It traces the genealogy of Afrasiyab from Jayumart, which is the Arabic version of Gayomart, the first human in Zoroastrian mythology. The lineage reads as follows:\\n\\nAfrasiyab >\\nBashank >\\nAnit >\\nRishman >\\nTurk >\\nRinsab >\\nArshast >\\nTuj >\\nAfridun (also known as Faridun) >\\nAtfiyan al-Barka >\\nA\\u1e6ffiy\\u0101n Naykaw >\\nAtfiyan Siyahka >\\nAtfiyan Sabidka >\\nAtfiyan Kafarka >\\nZami >\\nBifarust >\\nJam Shidh >\\nWiwanjahan >\\nAnkahad >\\nAninkahad >\\nUshahanj Pishd\\u0101d >\\nFarwal >\\nSiyamak >\\nMaysha >\\nJayumart \\n\\nThis lineage once again connects Afrasiyab back to the first human, showing his significant place in these ancient histories and mythologies.\",\"Zakariyya Gaznavi provides a more detailed account of Afrasiab's life and reign. According to him, Afrasiab ruled from the capital city of Shabran and had an underground palace with ditches filled with water, wine, milk, and kumiss, a fermented dairy product traditionally made from mare's milk.\\n\\nThe town of Gazvin is believed to be named after Afrasiab's daughter, and Afrasiab's reign over Persia lasted twelve years. His genealogy, as provided by Gaznavi, is as follows:\\n\\nAfrasiab >\\nPish (Pashang) >\\nDad Nashin (Zadsham) >\\nTur >\\nAfaridun\\n\\nOther scholars, like Al-Biruni and Ibn Khaldun, believed Afrasiab to be a descendant of Rustam, a hero in Persian mythology, tracing his lineage as follows:\\n\\nAfrasiab >\\nShabk (Shabran) >\\nRustam >\\nTurk >\\nKubor >\\nYafeth (Japheth in Biblical tradition) >\\nNuh (Noah in Biblical tradition)\\n\\nThe Sultans of Kashghar, part of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, were believed to be from the family of Afrasiab, whom the Moghuls call Bugha Khan. Ferdowsi states that Kara Khan, the father of Oghuz Khagan, was the fourth son of Afrasiab.\\n\\nAbu al-Ghazi Bahadur, in his Shajara-i Tar\\u0101kima, claimed that the Seljuks, who were masters of the Muslim world at one time, identified themselves as the Kinik tribe of the Turkmens, who fled from Kay Khosrow, the son of Afrasiab. The Seljuks traced their lineage back to Afrasiab after 35 generations, claiming to be his descendants.\\n\\nThese accounts show the widespread influence of Afrasiab across different regions and dynasties, underlining his significant role in Persian and Central Asian history and mythology.\",\"The passages you've provided are from the Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian text that provides an account of the creation of the world and other cosmological and mythological subjects. Specifically, these passages refer to Afrasiab (Frasiyav in this context) and his actions involving several bodies of water.\\n\\nIn Chapter 20, it's mentioned that Afrasiab redirected a thousand springs into the Kyansih sea. These springs were suitable for various domesticated animals, including horses, camels, oxen, and donkeys. He also directed the Zarinmand spring, identified as the Hetumand river, into the same sea. Additionally, Afrasiab redirected the seven navigable waters of the source of the Vachaeni river into the Kyansih sea and encouraged people to settle there.\\n\\nChapter 21 talks about the river Nahvtak, which Afrasiab also redirected. It prophesies that when Ushedar (a future savior figure in Zoroastrianism) comes, the river will flow again and be suitable for horses. The sea Kyansih, where these redirected waters flow, is described as the home of the Kayanian race.\\n\\nThese passages highlight Afrasiab's influence over the land and waters, as well as his connection to the Kayanian race, a legendary dynasty in Iranian tradition and literature.\",\"The letter you're referring to is from Shahnameh, the Persian epic composed by Ferdowsi. The letter is written by Afrasiyab to Kay Khosrow (Kay-Xasraw), who is the king of Iran and Afrasiyab's nephew. Afrasiyab had killed Kay Khosrow's father, Siavash, which set the stage for a long-standing enmity between them.\\n\\nIn this letter, Afrasiyab acknowledges their kinship but also points out that they are enemies, likely due to the treacherous act he committed against Siavash. He remarks on the harsh realities of the world where relatives can become mortal enemies. He also reminds Kay Khosrow of the gruesome fate of his father, likely in an attempt to intimidate or provoke him. The letter reflects the complex and fraught relationship between these two characters in the epic tale.\",null]. Error: sequence item 7: expected str instance, NoneType found\n",

Vacuum insulating glass (VIG) is an innovative architectural glass that combines vacuum technology with traditional insulating glass to create a highly insulating window. Some key features of VIG include:\\n\\n- **Slim construction**: VIG units consist of two lites of 4mm glass separated by a non-leaded proprietary metal seal and a vacuum space.\\n- **High insulation**: VIG offers wall-like insulation performance, with R-values of R14 or higher. This is 2-4 times better than conventional insulating glass.\\n- **Energy savings**: VIG can help reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions due to its superior insulation properties.\\n- **Acoustic performance**: VIG provides increased acoustic performance, reducing noise levels.\\n- **Reduced condensation**: VIG reduces center of glass condensation at temperatures as low as -58\\u00b0F.\\n\\nSome examples of VIG products include VacuMax\\u2122 by Vitro, V-Glass by V-Glass LLC, Pilkington Spacia\\u2122 by Pilkington, and HaanGlas Vacuum Insulating Glass. These products can be used in various window frame or curtain wall applications, making them practical for both residential and commercial use.\",\"A vacuum within a double glazed window, known as vacuum double glazing or vacuum insulation glass (VIG), does increase insulation. It has a vacuum between the panes of glass, which has very low thermal conductivity and a high thermal insulation coefficient. Some benefits of vacuum double glazing include:\\n\\n- **Thermal insulation**: Vacuum double glazing is more efficient than standard double glazing, as it has a vacuum cavity that prevents heat and sound from crossing.\\n- **Historic building restoration**: Vacuum double glazing is often used in historic building restoration projects, where existing single-glazed windows are retrofitted with vacuum glazing to improve thermal performance while maintaining the historic aesthetic.\\n- **Thin profile**: Vacuum glazing has a thin profile, making it ideal for fitting inside existing window frames and preserving the original sash and trim.\\n\\nHowever, there are some challenges associated with vacuum double glazing:\\n\\n- **Seals**: Proper installation and sealing are crucial for the effectiveness of vacuum glazing. If the seals fail, the vacuum will be compromised, reducing the insulation properties.\\n- **Manufacturing and maintenance**: Vacuum glazing requires a very high vacuum and needs to last for the whole life of the window, which may be 50 years or more.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a vacuum within a double glazed window does increase insulation, but it may be challenging to maintain the vacuum over time. Proper installation and sealing are essential for the effectiveness of vacuum glazing, and it may be more suitable for specific applications, such as historic building restoration.\"].

      "Error processing text: [\"To interface two MEMS microphone audio evaluation boards with an ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller using the ADC with DMA, you'll need to follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Pin Assignment**:\\n   - The ESP-WROOM-32 has multiple ADC channels that can be used for analog input. Assign two pins for the VCC and GND of each microphone, and two pins for the audio signal (AUD). Make sure the selected pins are not used for other purposes (like PWM, UART, etc.) and that they are capable of being used as ADC inputs.\\n\\n2. **Circular Buffer or Double Buffer**:\\n   - You can use a circular buffer to store the audio data, which allows you to read and write to the buffer without needing to check for buffer fullness. A double buffer can also be used, where you have two separate buffers and toggle between them, allowing for continuous read and write operations.\\n\\n3. **ADC Configuration**:\\n   - Configure the ESP-WROOM-32 ADC to use the channels assigned to the microphone inputs. Set the sampling rate to a suitable value based on the desired audio quality and the processing capabilities of the microcontroller. Higher sampling rates result in better quality but require more processing power.\\n\\n4. **DMA Configuration**:\\n   - Set up the DMA to transfer the ADC data to the circular or double buffer. The DMA will handle the data transfer in the background, freeing up the CPU to perform other tasks or process the audio data.\\n\\n5. **GPIO Configuration**:\\n   - Configure the GPIO pins used for VCC and GND as outputs and set them to the correct voltage levels (usually 3.3V for VCC and 0V for GND).\\n\\n6. **Code Structure**:\\n   - Your code should have two main threads: one for audio data acquisition using the ADC and DMA, and another for audio data processing and analysis. The acquisition thread will continuously read data from the microphones and store it in the buffer, while the processing thread will read the buffer and process the audio data.\\n\\n7. **Data Processing**:\\n   - The processing thread can perform various operations on the audio data, such as filtering, feature extraction, or even simple tasks like level detection or noise cancellation.\\n\\nHere's a basic outline of the code structure:\\n\\n```cpp\\n\\/\\/ Include necessary libraries\\n#include <driver\\/adc.h>\\n#include <driver\\/dma.h>\\n#include <esp_adc_cal.h>\\n\\n\\/\\/ Define pin numbers for VCC, GND, and AUD\\nconst int VCC_PIN = 23; \\/\\/ Example pin for VCC\\nconst int GND_PIN = 22; \\/\\/ Example pin for GND\\nconst int AUD_PIN = 21; \\/\\/ Example pin for AUD\\n\\n\\/\\/ Define ADC channel numbers\\nconst adc1_channel_t ADC_CHANNEL_VCC = ADC1_CHANNEL_0; \\/\\/ Example channel for VCC\\nconst adc1_channel_t ADC_CHANNEL_GND = ADC1_CHANNEL_1; \\/\\/ Example channel for GND\\nconst adc1_channel_t ADC_CHANNEL_AUD1 = ADC1_CHANNEL_2; \\/\\/ Example channel for AUD1\\nconst adc1_channel_t ADC_CHANNEL_AUD2 = ADC1_CHANNEL_3; \\/\\/ Example channel for AUD2\\n\\n\\/\\/ Define DMA channels\\nconst dma_channel_t DMA_CHANNEL_ADC_AUD1 = DMA_CHANNEL_0; \\/\\/ Example DMA channel for AUD1\\nconst dma_channel_t DMA_CHANNEL_ADC_AUD2 = DMA_CHANNEL_1; \\/\\/ Example DMA channel for AUD2\\n\\n\\/\\/ Circular buffer for audio data\\nuint16_t circular_buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];\\nvolatile uint16_t buffer_head = 0;\\nvolatile uint16_t buffer_tail = 0;\\n\\n\\/\\/ Initialize ADC, DMA, and GPIO\\nvoid init_hardware() {\\n    \\/\\/ Initialize ADC\\n    adc1_config_width(ADC_WIDTH_12Bit);\\n    adc1_config_channel_atten(ADC_CHANNEL_VCC, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11);\\n    adc1_config_channel_atten(ADC_CHANNEL_GND, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11);\\n    adc1_config_channel_atten(ADC_CHANNEL_AUD1, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11);\\n    adc1_config_channel_atten(ADC_CHANNEL_AUD2, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11);\\n\\n    \\/\\/ Initialize DMA\\n    dma_chan_config_t dma_config = {\\n        .dma_req_source = DMA_REQ_SRC_ADC,\\n        .periph_addr = (uint32_t)&ADC1,\\n        .periph_inc = false,\\n        .data_addr = (uint32_t)&circular_buffer[0],\\n        .data_inc = true,\\n        .transfer_dir = DMA_DIR_PERIPH_TO_MEM\\n    };\\n    dma_channel_init(DMA_CHANNEL_ADC_AUD1, &dma_config);\\n    dma_channel_init(DMA_CHANNEL_ADC_AUD2, &dma_config);\\n\\n    \\/\\/ Initialize GPIO\\n    gpio_set_direction(VCC_PIN, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);\\n    gpio_set_direction(GND_PIN, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);\\n    gpio_set_level(VCC_PIN, 1); \\/\\/ Set VCC to 3.3V\\n    gpio_\\u258c\",null,\"Apologies for the confusion earlier.

Collaboration: The LPS relies on collaboration between all stakeholders involved in a project, including owners, contractors, architects, engineers, and subcontractors. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.\\n2. Sequencing and scheduling: LPS uses a process called \\\"lookahead planning\\\" to anticipate and plan for future work. This helps to ensure that work is completed in a timely and efficient manner, and that resources are allocated effectively.\\n3. Communication: Effective communication is critical to the success of LPS. The system requires regular meetings between stakeholders to review progress, identify potential issues, and plan for future work.\\n4. Risk management: LPS includes a process for identifying and managing risks associated with a project. This helps to ensure that potential problems are identified early on and addressed before they become major issues.\\n5. Continuous improvement: LPS encourages continuous improvement and ongoing learning. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so that it can be tailored to meet the unique needs of each project.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n* Lean Construction Institute. (2019).

The Wiccan Rede: It states, \\\"An it harm none, do what ye will.\\\" This is the most fundamental ethical rule in Wicca. Essentially, it means that as long as your actions do not harm anyone, including yourself, they are ethically acceptable. \\n\\n2. The Rule of Three (also known as the Threefold Law or Law of Return): This is a belief that whatever energy a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to them three times. This encourages Wiccans to act in positive ways, avoiding harm towards others and promoting goodwill.\\n\\n3. Respect for Nature: Wicca is a nature-based religion that venerates the Earth and all its creatures. This respect extends to an ethical obligation to protect and preserve the environment.\\n\\n4. Personal Responsibility: Wiccans believe that each individual is responsible for their own actions. This extends to the concept that one's current situation is largely the product of past actions (karma).\\n\\n5. Respect for Others: Wiccans believe in treating others with kindness, compassion, and respect, recognizing the divine in everyone.\\n\\n6. Equality: Wicca emphasizes the equal value of all people, regardless of gender, race, age, or sexuality. This principle is often reflected in Wiccan rituals, which frequently focus on balance and harmony between masculine and feminine energies.\\n\\nThese principles are meant to guide Wiccans in their daily lives, helping them make ethical decisions. They promote a path of peace, harmony, and respect for all life. However, it's important to note that Wicca is a diverse religion and interpretations of these ethical guidelines can vary among different traditions and individuals.\",null,\"Yes, you're correct. The Wiccan Rede and the Rule of Three do indeed carry elements of both consequentialism and deontology, two major ethical theories.\\n\\nConsequentialism is an ethical theory that judges actions based on their outcomes or consequences. The most ethical action is the one that produces the best overall result. The Rule of Three embodies this thought, as it suggests that actions will return to the individual threefold, thus encouraging actions that lead to positive outcomes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, deontology is an ethical theory that states certain actions are intrinsically right or wrong, regardless of their outcomes. The Wiccan Rede falls into this category, as it provides a rule \\u2013 \\\"An it harm none, do what ye will\\\" \\u2013 that is to be followed irrespective of its consequences.\\n\\nIn practice, many Wiccans likely employ a mix of these ethical theories. They might strive to avoid harm (deontological ethics) while also considering the potential outcomes of their actions (consequentialist ethics). As with many ethical and religious systems, Wiccan ethics can be complex and multifaceted.\"]. Error: sequence item 1: expected str instance, NoneType found\n",

      "Error processing text: [\"The Wiccan view of ethics centers around the Wiccan Rede, which states: \\\"An it harm none, do what ye will.\\\" This means that Wiccans are free to do as they choose, as long as they harm no one - including themselves. The core ethical principles in Wicca are:\\n\\n1. Do not harm others. Wiccans believe in the sacredness of all life, so they avoid harming others either through action or inaction. They seek to heal, not harm.\\n\\n2. Respect nature. Wiccans believe the earth itself is sacred, so they seek to live in harmony with nature and the environment. They avoid polluting or damaging the natural world. \\n\\n3. Respect others' freedoms. Wiccans believe individuals should be free to follow their own spiritual path. So they respect the freedoms and beliefs of others, as long as those others also respect others' freedoms in turn.\\n\\n4. Take responsibility for your actions. Wiccans believe in taking personal responsibility for one's actions and deeds. They do not blame others or externalize responsibility for their own decisions and behaviors.\\n\\n5. Seek harmony and balance. Wiccans believe in living a balanced life in harmony with the greater whole. So they avoid extremes of behavior and seek moderation in all areas of life.\\n\\n6. Continue learning and improving. Wiccans follow a path of constant self-improvement through learning, reflection, and experience. They continue advancing their knowledge and skills over the whole of their lives.\\n\\n7. Celebrate life. Wiccans view life as a joyous journey, so they celebrate the pleasures in each moment and seek to spread that joy to others whenever possible.\\n\\nThat covers the basic principles of Wiccan ethics as I understand them. Let me know if you have any other questions!\",null,\"That's an insightful observation. You're right that the Wiccan Rede and Rule of Three essentially express consequentialist ethical principles in the form of deontological rules.\\n\\nSome key points:\\n\\n\\u2022 The Wiccan Rede - \\\"An it harm none, do what ye will\\\" - suggests that the consequences of an action, specifically whether it causes harm, are most important. This is a consequentialist view. However, it is expressed as an absolute rule to follow, which seems deontological.\\n\\n\\u2022 The Rule of Three - \\\"Whatever energy a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to that person three times.\\\" - also focuses on the consequences of one's actions, specifically the returned spiritual effects. But it is stated as a universal moral rule, which is deontological in form.\\n\\n\\u2022 Wicca in general focuses more on the consequences and effects of one's actions than following strict moral rules. But these two well-known Wiccan maxims take a deontological rule-based form, even while capturing consequentialist principles.\\n\\n\\u2022 You could say these rules represent a kind of \\\"consequentialist deontology\\\" in Wicca - moral rules are stated in absolute terms, but they are based on and aim at achieving good consequences. The rules are there to serve the higher aim of harming none and promoting balance.\\n\\nSo in summary, you make a very astute point. The Wiccan Rede and Rule of Three synthesize consequentialist ethics with deontological rules in an interesting way. They express consequentialist principles in the form of moral rules to follow. This fusion of ethical approaches is quite fascinating, and rather unique to Wicca.\"]. Error: sequence item 1: expected str instance, NoneType found\n",

However, some of the key factors that contribute to poverty in Africa include political instability, corruption, lack of infrastructure, inadequate access to education and healthcare, conflicts and wars, and limited economic opportunities.\\nPolitical instability and corruption have hindered economic development in many African countries. When governments are unstable or corrupt, it can lead to a lack of investment in critical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and ports, which are essential for economic growth.\\nLack of access to education and healthcare is another major factor contributing to poverty in Africa. Many African countries have low levels of education and healthcare, which limits opportunities for economic advancement and increases the risk of illness and disease.\\nConflicts and wars can also contribute to poverty in Africa by disrupting economic activity and causing displacement of people.\\nFinally, limited economic opportunities, such as lack of access to credit, land, and markets, can make it difficult for people in Africa to lift themselves out of poverty.\\nIt is important to note that poverty is not inevitable, and many African countries have made significant progress in reducing poverty in recent years. However, addressing the root causes of poverty in Africa will require sustained efforts and a commitment to promoting economic growth, social development, and political stability.\",null,\"Adolf Hitler was one of the most notorious figures in modern history, responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people during World War II and the Holocaust.

He is also able to fly, is invulnerable to most forms of harm, and has a seemingly endless supply of energy.\\nWhile both characters are incredibly powerful and have unique abilities, it is difficult to say who is stronger between the two.

The ship was unlike anything Zephyr had ever seen before, with sleek lines and advanced technology that seemed almost otherworldly.\\nZephyr was fascinated by the ship and decided to explore it further.

The robot introduced itself as Ada, and explained that it was a prototype designed by the empire's top engineers.\\nZephyr and Ada quickly became fast friends, and Zephyr began to learn all he could about the spaceship and its advanced technology. Ada, in turn, was fascinated by Zephyr and his abilities, and the two spent countless hours exploring the galaxy together.\\nAs they traveled through space, Zephyr and Ada encountered all manner of strange and wondrous creatures, including other dragons and intelligent alien species. Together, they faced many challenges and adventures, but always managed to overcome them with their combined skills and abilities.\\nEventually, Zephyr and Ada returned to the Byzantine Empire, where they were hailed as heroes for their bravery and adventurous spirit. The empire's rulers saw the value of the advanced technology that Zephyr and Ada had brought back, and began to incorporate it into their own technologies and society.\\nThanks to Zephyr and Ada, the Byzantine Empire continued to thrive in the centuries to come, becoming one of the most powerful and advanced civilizations in the galaxy.

Some of the potential side effects include:\\n\\n\\u2022 Urethral stricture or narrowing: The urethra can become inflamed and narrowed from radiation exposure, making it difficult to urinate. This can often be treated with dilation or minor surgery.\\n\\n\\u2022 Urinary incontinence: Damage to the urethral sphincter muscles or nerves can lead to loss of bladder control and incontinence. This is usually temporary but can be permanent in some men.\\n\\n\\u2022 Erectile dysfunction: Radiation can damage the nerve bundles that control erection, known as the neurovascular bundles. This can lead to difficulty getting or maintaining an erection. Erectile dysfunction can often be treated with medications or other therapies.\\n\\n\\u2022 Rectal inflammation or bleeding: The rectum sits close to the prostate, so radiation exposure can lead to rectal side effects like inflammation, pain, bleeding or ulcers. This is usually temporary but can require treatment.\\n\\n\\u2022 Fatigue: Radiation therapy often causes significant fatigue that may last for several months. Extra rest and limiting activities can help relieve fatigue.\\n\\n\\u2022 Other side effects: Additional side effects may include increased frequency or urgency to urinate, painful urination or ejaculation, hip or pelvic pain, and temporary hair loss in the genital area.\\n\\nMost side effects are temporary but some may continue long term or be permanent. The risks tend to be lower with modern radiation techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) that better target the prostate while sparing surrounding tissues. Close follow-up with your doctor and proactively managing any side effects can help reduce discomfort and risks.\",null,null]. Error: sequence item 1: expected str instance, NoneType found\n",

The specific side effects may vary depending on the individual and the specific treatment plan, but here are some common side effects:\\n\\n1. Urethral irritation: Radiation can cause inflammation and irritation of the urethra, leading to symptoms such as increased frequency of urination, urgency, burning or pain during urination, and blood in the urine.\\n\\n2. Urinary incontinence: In some cases, radiation therapy can lead to urinary incontinence, which is the inability to control urine flow. This can range from mild leakage to more severe cases requiring the use of pads or other management techniques.\\n\\n3. Erectile dysfunction: Radiation can damage the nerve bundles that are responsible for normal erectile function. This can result in erectile dysfunction, making it difficult to achieve or maintain an erection suitable for sexual intercourse.\\n\\n4. Changes in ejaculation: Radiation therapy can also affect ejaculation. Some men may experience a decrease in the amount of semen produced or a change in the sensation of ejaculation.\\n\\nIt's important to note that not all individuals will experience these side effects, and the severity can vary. Additionally, side effects may improve over time, but some may be long-term or permanent. It's crucial to discuss potential side effects with your doctor before undergoing radiation therapy and to address any concerns or questions you may have.\",null,null].

It relies on the model's general understanding of language to make inferences based on the input it receives.\\n\\nWhen you provide 2 examples in the prompt, it is still considered zero-shot learning. The model uses its general knowledge and understanding of the language to make predictions based on the examples provided. The term \\\"shots\\\" in this context is not used to refer to the number of examples, but rather to the number of times the model is exposed to a specific concept or task during its training. In zero-shot learning, the model has not been explicitly trained on the concept or task at all, which makes it more challenging for the model to make accurate predictions.\",\"In the context of LLM, \\\"shots\\\" refer to the number of times the model is exposed to a specific concept or task during its training. When you ask for an example of 3 shots, it means you want me to provide a scenario where a model has been trained on a specific concept or task three times.\\n\\nFor example, consider a model that is being trained to classify different types of fruits. The model is exposed to various fruits three times during its training:\\n\\n1. First shot: The model is trained on a dataset containing images of apples, oranges, and bananas, along with their corresponding labels (apple, orange, and banana).\\n2.

The model is exposed to images of oranges, lemons, and grapefruits, along with their labels.\\n\\nAfter being trained in this way, the model has been exposed to each fruit three times, from different angles and in different contexts, which can help improve its ability to accurately classify the fruits.\",\"In the context of LLM, \\\"shots\\\" refer to the exposure of the model to a specific concept or task during its training. When you say \\\"3 shots,\\\" it means that the model has been trained on that concept or task three times.\\n\\nEach shot can involve multiple examples, but it is not necessarily the case that each shot has to include different examples.

Drawing cars can be challenging due to their complex shapes and proportions. Here are some tips that may help you improve your car drawing skills:\\n\\n1. **Study Car Designs**: Before you start drawing, look at pictures of cars from different angles. Pay attention to the basic shapes that make up a car, such as rectangles, circles, and cylinders.\\n\\n2. **Understand Proportions**: Get a feel for the size relationships between different parts of the car. The wheels are usually the same size, and the car's height is typically about half of its length.\\n\\n3. **Start with Basic Shapes**: Begin your drawing with simple shapes. Draw a rectangle for the base, then add circles for the wheels. You can add more rectangles or cylinders for the body and other parts.\\n\\n4. **Perspective**: If you're struggling with drawing a car from a particular angle, practice drawing perspective grids first. This will help you understand how the car's shapes will look from different viewpoints.\\n\\n5. **Refine Your Drawing**: Once you have the basic shapes in place, start refining them. Add details like the door handles, windows, and grille. Pay attention to the car's curves and lines.\\n\\n6. **Scale and Size**: Make sure the car's wheels are the right size in proportion to the rest of the car. Often, the wheels will determine the size of the rest of the vehicle.\\n\\n7. **Lighting and Shadows**: Add shadows and highlights to give your drawing depth and realism. This will also help you understand the shapes and forms of the car better.\\n\\n8. **Use References**: It's okay to use references when you're learning. A photo or a real-life car can help you see how certain details should look.\\n\\n9. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Like any skill, drawing takes practice. Keep at it, and your skills will improve over time.\\n\\n10. **Get Feedback**: Show your drawings to friends or join an art group where you can get constructive feedback. This can help you see areas where you can improve.\\n\\nRemember, everyone starts off as a beginner, and improvement comes with consistent effort and practice. Don't get discouraged if your drawings don't come out perfect right away. Keep practicing, and you'll see progress!\",null]. Error: sequence item 2: expected str instance, NoneType found\n",

Add details: Once you have the basic shapes down, start adding details like headlights, taillights, grilles, and mirrors. Keep in mind that these details will vary depending on the type of car you're drawing.\\n4. Practice shading: Shading can add depth and dimension to your drawings. Start with light shading and gradually build up to darker areas. Experiment with different shading techniques to see what works best for you.\\n5. Experiment with different angles: Try drawing cars from different angles to challenge yourself and improve your skills. This will help you understand how the shape of a car changes depending on the perspective.\\n6. Be patient: Drawing cars can be challenging, so don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away. Keep practicing and experimenting, and you'll see improvement over time.\\n\\nI hope these tips help you with your car drawings! Remember, practice makes perfect.
